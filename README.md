# Data Analytics on World Happiness Report 2021

The World Happiness Report is a yearly-basis landmark survey for the purpose of Sustainable Development, powered by data from the Gallup World Poll and Lloyd’s Register Foundation, who provided access to the World Risk Poll. It contains the happiness score among different countries estimated by six main factors - economic production, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity. 

The report has been providing a new insight to governments and organizations about “manage by happiness”. Happiness is gradually replacing capital gain as the indicator for decision makers to work out the most reasonably practicable policies. To realize this target, multi-disciplinary professionals such as economics, health, statistic, etc., are involved to effectively quantify happiness. In this report, the happiness level in the world is reviewed for illustrating the variation of happiness against those main factors. 

We are curious on the following issues: 

- How does the datasets look like? 
- What is the difference between two datasets? 
- What countries are the happiest and unhappiest?  
- What makes these countries happiest or unhappiest?  
- Is there any happiness index difference by regions? Do regions adjacent to each other have similar happiness? 
- How does columns values vary with time? Which countries have greatly changed from 2007 to 2020? 
- Can we predict the happiness index? If yes, how? 
- Can we group the countries based on their happiness index? If yes, how and how many clusters? 

Therefore, we would like to use Python and its associated integrated development environment as the main tool for this project, it includes: 

- Language: Python 
- Integrated development environment: Jupyter notebook for collaborative work 
- Statistical analytics library: sklearn, pandas, numpy, tensorflow 
- Visualization frameworks: pycountry, geopandas, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn
